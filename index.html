        <p>Youngling, This is your first trial. Look for an Invisec, home to many species of Aliens, called "Republic City". Held there, away from the Humanoids that claim Coruscant. In there, a young Taung child. Bring her back to her home plant "Roon". This is a very dangerous mission as most Jedi have been extinct; Be mindful and aware. STAY LOW!</p></div>
